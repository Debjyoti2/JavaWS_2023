//	Context switching is basically an important feature of multithreading. It is referred to as switching
//	of CPU from one thread or process to another one. It allows multiple processes to share the same CPU.
//	In context switching, the state of thread or process is stored so that the execution
//	of the thread can be resumed later if required.
